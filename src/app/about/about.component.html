  Wondering where to organize information about all your contacts? 
</p>
<p>
  Get started with My Contacts application which allows you to create contacts and store basic information about them. 
</p>
<p>
  You can also edit or delete a contact. 
</p>
<p>
  If you are not sure about deleting one, you can set the status to inactive instead.
